# ethercalc_theme_green
Ethercalc skin green like a famous spreadsheet software

INSTALL:
--------
Once ethercalc is installed (https://github.com/audreyt/ethercalc), overwrite your node_modules folder with the content in this repo to get your green theme running.

COMPATIBILITY:
--------------
Currently, the version available is compatible with Ethercalc released latest on the 16th of march 2015. You will find this theme in folder called 150316.
I am planing to update the theme on the current version.

As a side note, all the files ending by "-s" are the original files ("-s" meaning saved for me). So if you ever want to update this theme for a newer version of ethercalc, just check the differences between each file with his twin ending with "-s" in this repo . You will know then what to change in any new coming version of ethercalc.
