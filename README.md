# ethercalc_theme_green

Once ethercalc is installed (https://github.com/audreyt/ethercalc), overwrite your node_modules folder with the content of this folder to get your green theme running.

Remark: this is tested for 2014 version of Ethercalc. All the files ending by "-s" are the original files ("-s" meaning saved).
